This project is in its early days. 

# Velocity Dashboard

This project is heavily inspired by two other products: MomentumDash and Nighttab

The goal of Velocity is to be the go-to browser extension for web developers, offering a bunch of handy integrations and shortcuts with a primarily keyboard driven interface reminiscing that of a terminal. Velocity also aims to be highly customizable, modular and stilish. (Hopefully browsers will become part of a ricing setup)

Initially, I was going to fork Nighttab, however as I saw it was made with an ad hoc vanilla JS framework, I decided to make my own version in React. However I decided to use Gatsby instead of CRA or some other framework built around react because I wanted my page to load as fast as possible.
Preact would also be another good candidate, however I like the pre-rendering aspect of GatsbyJS.
